                            The front-end of this site uses Blazor WebAssembly.  I self-host it on a water-cooled AMD Threadripper server in my home.
                            It is currently running the latest Ubuntu 22.04 Long-Term Support release.

                            Back-end data for this site is stored using a MariaDB database.  Upon filling out the
                            Contact Me form, the WASM application communicates back to a .NET 6 API Gateway running
                            on the same server as the front-end UI.  The gateway can then complete the request by putting
                            your message into my database for retrieval.

                            I started my IT "career" at a young age.  My parents bought a 66Mhz Intel i486 with 8MB of RAM
                            sometime around 1993 and I was instantly hooked.  It was pretty out-dated by the time I hit
                            middle school, but we managed to acquire multiple hand-me-down systems, and by 7th or 8th grade
                            I had learned to swap hard drives into the newer systems to recover my old games.

                            Throughout high-school I built and upgraded dozens of budget gaming PC's for myself
                            and friends as often as our summer and weekend jobs allowed.

                            The more formal part of my IT career began directly out of high school when I accepted a job
                            at the IT Department for my local school district.

                            From there I did stints at a mom-and pop shop, a university, and as a phone-support technician for
                            a company building factory-overclocked systems for day-traders.  My final role in IT support came in
                            the form of a long stretch with some well-known orange geeks at a large blue-hued electronics retailer.

                            I always knew that my true love was writing code.  I had been a hobbyist coder for the better part
                            of a decade, but always struggled to keep my work organized as my projects grew large.  I decided
                            that I wanted to get serious and went to college for computer science.

                            Two years into my education, before even graduating, I obtained a role as a web developer.
                            I continued soldiering through the classes even though I was working full-time and finished out
                            my bachelor's degree in Spring 2022, by then several years into my role as a professional dev.
